<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>The Forms7 plugin will iterate over the fields in your HTML form and store the fields as a JSON object in one field in your SharePoint list. Using Forms7 you can promote fields to SharePoint list fields as well as add custom validation of fields.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Forms7 puts the power of the forms in the hands of your business again by allowing non-technical users to create attractive forms using any HTML editor and passing that HTML off to your JavaScript developers should additional functionality want to be added like conditionally hiding/showing fields.</span></p>
<p>Forms7 is a great InfoPath alternative for users wanting to move away from that technology for their basic forms needs.<br /> <br /> An earlier version of Forms7 is currently in use by a fortune 100 company storing 9 different forms in one list with great success. <br /> <br /> Forms7 is free, and for free, it does have it's limitations including:<br /> <br /> 1) People Pickers are not currently supported<br /> 2) It's in ALPHA!! I've not tested every possible iteration and possibility. <br /> 3) Documentation is currently light (non-existent) but this will be added as interest grows.</p>
<p>Forms7 uses SPServices to read and write SharePoint list data (http://spservices.codeplex.com). Future plans include a supported version that uses the Client Object Model.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">How can you help?? Let me know you are interested so that I've got some motivation to document and improve this promising technology.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>The included Sample Form will help you get started until I can get some actual documentation in place. To use the sample form without modifications:</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">1) copy the form and script to a "SiteAssets" document library on your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">2) Create a list called "Contacts" and add a multiline plain text field called "Forms7Data".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">3) Create a Web Part Page called "SampleForm" under Site Pages</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">4) Drop a Content Editor Web Part on the page and link it to ../SiteAssets/sampleForm.html</span></p>
